# WASP-43-b-Quantifying-Molecular-Abundances-in-the-Atmosphere
This project aims to identify molecules and quanitfy their abundances using high-resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy.
'Combined CCF' is the cross-correlation code I wrote that is used to detect the presence of specific molecules in the atmosphere.
'Run pymultinest' is the code I contributed to that retrieves the abundances of the detected molecules
'CO2 Model' is the model I created using the PetitRADTRANS coding package to create a spectral graph of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of WASP-43b.
